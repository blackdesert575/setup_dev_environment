#what is shell in Linux?

#In Linux, a shell is a program that interprets commands and provides an interface for users to interact with the operating system. It is also known as a command-line interpreter (CLI). Users can type commands into the shell, which are then executed by the operating system. The shell provides a way to access the file system, run programs, and manage system resources. There are different types of shells available in Linux, such as Bash, Zsh, Ksh, and others, each with its own features and capabilities.
